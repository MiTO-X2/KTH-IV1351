IV1351-HT24-Data-Storage-Paradigms-Soundgood

The goal of this project was to create a database for an imaginary music School called Soundgood. The database is specialized in loaning instruments for students and teachers. We created it from the ground up, from a conceptual model to a fully working database. Though for the final product we used code from our professor Leif Lindb√§ck as skeleton code.

The sql files in the directory are files containing the unfinished prodcut, with Tables1.sql and database.sql being our first attempt to create an SQL database and the rest were later stages were we attempted to implement queries for the database.

In the task4 is the final product. Which we recommend you to check out.

Create the database with these files: database.sql (creates the database) and queries.sql (contains queries which can be useful for the database)
